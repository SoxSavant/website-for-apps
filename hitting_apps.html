                Frustrated that it doesn't include defense, baserunning, and Statcast metrics?

                Pages from years prior to Statcast can also be created with non-Statcast stats, all the way back to the 1800s.
            You can automatically list stats from greatest to least, or vice versa, too.</p>

                a minimum PA threshold can be created and displayed at the top. If a player's headshot doesn't load,
